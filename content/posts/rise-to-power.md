Charlemagne's rise to power was one rife with corruption and nepotism. His father, Pippin III's offical title was "Mayor to the Palace", an assistant to the the King and royals during Merovingian dynasty. It is widely spectulated by historians that he actually held much more power than his title would suggest. Pippin III quickly rose to power, ascending to the throne of the Frankish Kingdom after the death of Childeric III, ending the Merovingian dynasty's rule over Europe.

In 768 CE, Pippin III died, leaving the Kingdom to his two sons, Charles I and Carloman I. Soon after the death of Pippen III, Charles I and Carloman I's relationship grew contentious. The tensions continued to munt with minor skirmishes occuring between the brother's empires. However, before tensions could spiral out of control and lead to war, Carloman I died due to what is suspected to be natural causes. After this Carloman I's eldest son, Pepin, was expected to be appointed as king. Despite this, through the help of the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church, Charlemagne was able to reunite his father, Pippin III's kingdom.
